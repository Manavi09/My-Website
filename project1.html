    <h2>Stock Pricing Analysis using SAS</h2>

    <p>
      This project explores historical stock market data—spanning thousands of U.S. stocks and ETFs—to analyze 
      and predict price movements using multiple statistical and time series approaches in SAS. The core dataset 
      contains daily Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume values for each ticker from about 1960 onward, with no 
      missing values found. Key activities and findings include:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Data Cleaning &amp; Exploration</strong><br><br>
      Verified no missing values in the selected sample (10 major companies including Google, General Electric, 
      and Johnson &amp; Johnson).<br><br>
      Visualized overall trends: Google showed a steady upward trend with minimal dips, whereas GE and J&amp;J 
      exhibited flatter periods in earlier decades followed by more pronounced fluctuations.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Regression Models</strong><br><br>
      <em>Linear Regression:</em> Used Open as the dependent variable and Close, High, Low, Volume as predictors.<br>
      Pvalues &lt; 0.001 confirmed the regression models were statistically significant.<br>
      Volume often turned out to be insignificant; Close, High, and Low were consistently important predictors.<br>
      <em>Pooled OLS:</em> Extended the linear approach across time; confirmed Close and High/Low metrics have strong 
      explanatory power for Open in subsequent days.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Time Series Approaches</strong><br><br>
      <em>Simple Time Series &amp; ACF:</em> Showed positive autocorrelation in the Open and Close prices 
      (i.e., past values strongly influence future values). A White Noise Probability test indicated no white noise, 
      reinforcing that price sequences have meaningful structure.<br><br>
      <em>Exponential Smoothing:</em> Revealed that Google’s daily Open/Close maintained steady growth with notable 
      dips around the 2008 recession, while GE and J&amp;J’s data contained more frequent highs and lows starting 
      from the mid-1990s. The error distributions were near-normal, indicating relatively well-behaved residuals.<br><br>
      <em>Moving Average:</em> Illustrated how short-term price movements (e.g., 5-day windows) smoothed out daily 
      volatility, highlighting clear uptrends (Google, J&amp;J post-1990) and downtrends (GE post-2001).<br><br>
      <em>ARIMA Models:</em><br>
      Autoregressive parameters were significant (high t-values), verifying strong dependence on prior prices.<br>
      Low t-values for mean terms indicated they contributed little to model accuracy.<br>
      Residual diagnostics suggested the absence of white noise, confirming that the data exhibit autocorrelations 
      that ARIMA can capture.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Conclusions</strong><br><br>
      The previous day’s Close price is highly predictive of the next day’s Open, aligning with real-world 
      investor behaviors.<br><br>
      Although Volume was hypothesized to be influential, it was not consistently significant across models—suggesting 
      that price movements for these particular companies may be driven more by past price behavior than by raw trade volume.<br><br>
      The 2008 financial crisis surfaced as a clear disruptor in upward trends for most companies, indicating the 
      responsiveness of stock prices to macroeconomic events.<br><br>
      Overall, the combination of regression (Linear, Pooled OLS) and time series (Exponential Smoothing, Moving 
      Average, ARIMA) methods provided nuanced insights into stock price behavior. The project demonstrates how 
      careful model selection, statistical testing (p-values, t-values, autocorrelation checks), and time series 
      diagnostics can help analysts better understand market trends and enhance investment decision-making.
