    <h2>About Me</h2>

      My Professional Journey​​
      My journey into data analysis commenced with a degree in Computer Science Engineering at Nagpur University, India. I had several database foundation courses during my bachelors. I have always been fascinated by the fact that we have so much to learn in the world and data being the source of it. Be it everyday activities like learning a new language, exploring travel destinations, deciding what to order from your favorite restaurant or be it transforming businesses to make critical decisions that define sustainable growth while ensuring customer satisfaction, Data has a role to play everywhere. This curiosity led me to pursue a Masters degree in Business Analytics from The University of Texas at Dallas. After Graduation, I have been working with major Consulting companies like Atos Syntel and HCLTech for more than 4.5 years with clients in Banking, Financial Services, Transportation and Logistics. Over the course of my career, I've refined my proficiency in a multitude of analytical tools and programming languages, including SQL, Tableau, Python, SAS and Excel, allowing me to tackle diverse data challenges efficiently.

      On a More Personal Perspective
      In addition to my professional journey as a Data Analyst, I immerse myself in various passions that ignite my creativity and drive.  l am trained in Kathak, an Indian classical dance form and have completed a Senior Diploma in Dance from Gwalior University, India. I run an Instagram handle by the name @manavirawatofficial where I post my dance videos and collaborations as a fashion model. Beyond dance, I find joy in playing musical instruments like Synthesizer, Piano, and Ukulele. I also indulge my inner artist through painting canvases, allowing me to explore new realms of creativity. Outside of my creative interests, I cherish moments with my family and have a special affection for dogs, which adds warmth and balance to my life.
