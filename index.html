    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Naturally curious and passionate Data Analyst dedicated to transforming 
      raw data into actionable insights. With a solid foundation in Data 
      Analytics and Business Intelligence, I excel at analyzing complex 
      datasets and helping businesses make informed decisions.

    <p>
      <strong>My Professional Journey</strong><br />
      My journey into data analysis commenced with a degree in Computer Science 
      Engineering at Nagpur University, India. I had several database foundation 
      courses during my bachelors. I have always been fascinated by the fact 
      that we have so much to learn in the world and data being the source of 
      it. Be it everyday activities like learning a new language, exploring 
      travel destinations, deciding what to order from your favorite restaurant 
      or be it transforming businesses to make critical decisions that define 
      sustainable growth while ensuring customer satisfaction, Data has a role 
      to play everywhere. This curiosity led me to pursue a Masters degree in 
      Business Analytics from The University of Texas at Dallas. After Graduation, 
      I have been working with major Consulting companies like Atos Syntel and 
      HCLTech for more than 4.5 years with clients in Banking, Financial Services, 
      Transportation and Logistics. Over the course of my career, I've refined 
      my proficiency in a multitude of analytical tools and programming languages, 
      including SQL, Tableau, Python, SAS and Excel, allowing me to tackle 
      diverse data challenges efficiently.

        <h3>Life Expectancy Analysis Using Python</h3>
        
        <p class="overview">
          In this project, I explored global life expectancy data to uncover
          what socioeconomic, demographic, and healthcare factors most strongly
          impact how long people live around the world. Employing Python’s data
          analytics ecosystem (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), I cleaned
          and transformed raw data, filled in missing values, and performed
          descriptive and inferential analysis.

          <h4>Key Highlights</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Data Cleaning &amp; Exploration:</strong> Handled missing data
              systematically, identified outliers, and used visualization techniques to spot trends.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Correlation &amp; Regression:</strong> Investigated correlations 
              between life expectancy and variables like GDP, healthcare spending, 
              and literacy rates. Built regression models (e.g., Linear Regression) 
              to predict life expectancy based on these factors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Created clear, compelling plots and charts 
              that highlighted global discrepancies in life expectancy and offered insights 
              into policy changes that might improve overall lifespans.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Outcome:</strong> Demonstrated how data-driven decision-making can inform 
              public health initiatives, underscore inequalities, and guide resource allocation 
              to improve longevity across different regions.
            </li>
